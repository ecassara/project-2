            Double Rex Rat">
            <figcaption>
              Image of baby Choobie. She is a Blue Double Rex Rat. This means her
              fur color is Blue and she has curly whiskers and wavy fur, hence
              the "double rex" description. The color "Blue" in the rat breeding
              industry describes a specific shade of grey that has a blue hue.

              Image of Nina sleeping. She is a grey rat with white marbling and a
              white belly. She was a cuddler and loved nap time very much. She
              also loved being scratched behind the ears as many rats do.

              couch. Me or my sister probably called her out to come get a treat
              from us. Most of my rats were trained to know that when we made
              kissy noises, or some simliar noise, that they should come to us.
              They were mostly motivated by food to do this.
