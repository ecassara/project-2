        <figcaption>
          Image of baby Choobie. She is a Blue Double Rex Rat. This means her
          fur color is Blue and she has curly whiskers and wavy fur, hence
          the "double rex" description. The color "Blue" in the rat breeding
          industry describes a specific shade of grey that has a blue hue.

          Image of Nina sleeping. She is a grey rat with white marbling and a
          white belly. She was a cuddler and loved nap time very much. She
          also loved being scratched behind the ears as many rats do.
