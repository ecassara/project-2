              Image of baby Choobie. She is a Blue Double Rex Rat. This means her
              fur color is Blue and she has curly whiskers and wavy fur, hence
              the "double rex" description. The color "Blue" in the rat breeding
              industry describes a specific shade of grey that has a blue hue.
